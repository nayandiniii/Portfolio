    <!-- Project 1 -->
    <h2 style="font-family: techmono; text-decoration: underline;color: #4bffa5; text-align: center;">SilverCure</h2>
    <p class="content2">The project at hand revolves around addressing the critical challenge of mental health and well-being among the aging population, particularly concerning the complex mental disorder, schizophrenia. As individuals age, they become increasingly susceptible to mental health disorders, which if left unaddressed, can lead to a diminished quality of life and strain healthcare systems. Schizophrenia, characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, altered attention, and behavioral changes, presents a unique journey that demands both understanding and empathy.

        The primary aim of the project is to combat the prevailing social stigma surrounding mental health and schizophrenia. This is achieved through a multi-faceted approach that emphasizes knowledge dissemination, open dialogues, and acceptance. By fostering awareness and empathy, the project seeks to create a supportive environment for those affected by schizophrenia, enabling them to lead more fulfilling lives.</p><br><br>

    <h2 style="font-family: techmono; text-decoration: underline;color: #4bffa5; text-align: center;">RespiScan</h2>
    <!-- Additional content for RespiScan project can be added here -->
    <p class="content2">RespiScan can be experienced and used in production as a user-friendly tool for individuals who want to assess their risk of developing lung cancer from the comfort of their own homes. Users can input their basic information and symptoms into the RespiScan model, and receive a prediction of their likelihood of having lung cancer.

        The model could be integrated into a web-based platform or mobile application, which could be easily accessed by users. The platform could also provide educational resources on lung cancer prevention and early detection, which could help users reduce their risk of developing the disease.
        
        Overall, RespiScan has the potential to be a valuable tool for individuals who are concerned about their risk of developing lung cancer, as it can provide a quick and convenient way to assess their risk and take appropriate action to prevent or detect the disease.</p>
